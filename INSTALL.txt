Installing from source
======================

If you are not familiar with "cmake" these instructions may be helpful when compiling from source and installing. 
These instructions assume you have `cmake`, `git`, `make` and your C toolchain installed.

1. Clone this repository and change into the source directory
2. Use cmake to generate your "Unix Makefiles"
3. Use make to build the nvi binary
4. Copy/Move[^1] the nvi binary to your desired install location (e.g. `$HOME/bin`)
5. Copy the manual page to your man path (e.g. `$HOME/man/man1`)
6. Finally you can symlink nvi as nex to get the "ex" cli

Here's the steps I took in my shell

```
git clone git@github.com:lichray/nvi2
cd nvi2
cmake --fresh -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make
mv nvi $HOME/bin/
cp man/vi.1 $HOME/man/man1/
cd $HOME/bin
ln nvi nex
cd
```

[^1]: On macOS you may need to use move (i.e. `mv`) instead of copy (i.e. `cp`)
